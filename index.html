<p>My name is Mike Hardy. I was born in Charleston South Carolina but wasn't there for long. I grew up in Northern California. I went to elementary school in Fairfield. We moved to Travis AFB when I was 11. I lived there for 8 years before moving to Arizona.</p>

<p>After living in Arizona for about 3 months I decided to join the USCG. I spent the majority of my time on the east coast, spiltting time between NY, Connecticut & NJ. When I got out of the CG, i decided to go to school at ASU.</p>
